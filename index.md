# Hello
This site will eventually hold some of the setup and use information for the ArcMap Tools to QC Transit On-Board Survey data.  Since I'm not at the point (yet) of having things ready, you'll have to check back later.

In the meantime, [there is a presentation on this](http://www.trbappcon.org/2013conf/presentations/111_Building%20Open%20Source%20Tools%20to%20QC%20Transit%20Survey.pptm) that I gave at the TRB Transportation Planning Applications Conference.  There's a paper uploaded to the website as well, but it is a test paper (I'm the committee webmaster).

If you have any questions, you can get in contact with me [via email](mailto:arohne@oki.org) or [on twitter](http://twitter.com/okiAndrew).
