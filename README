This is an ArcMap add-in to help with QC-ing a transit on-board survey.

There are currently two buttons implemented and two more planned.

The two buttons implemented are:

The Definition Query Button, which sets the definition query of the Boarding 
Locations, Alighting Locations, and Destination Locations layers based on the 
selected items in the Origin Locations layer.

The Flip OD Button, which flips the origin and destination coordinates for 
those people that responded that they were coming from a place they were
actually going to.


The two planned buttons are:

A button to fix address geocoding.  There's normally a lot of that, so I'm 
trying to figure out a way to fix the address geocoding one-by-one as opposed
to setting all the incorrectly geocoded addresses to 1,1 or 0,0 or -1,-1 and
batch geocoding all those later. 

The Definition Query Button based on destination location.


NOTES FOR USE:
This requires ArcMap 10.  Other versions may work.  If they don't, well, sorry about your luck.

In some of the scripts, fields are hard-coded.  Check the scripts.
